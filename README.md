# Naive Bayes classifier built from scratch 

This is a Naive Bayes classifier I built without the help of any packages (except 'math') - even pandas. It reads a csv file, trains the model and predicts the class of instances. It also outputs accuracy and error rate of the classifier and information gain of each attribute in the dataset.
